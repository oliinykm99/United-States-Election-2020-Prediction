## Project Overview

This project examines how county characteristics influence voting behavior in the 2020 United States election. It explores factors like population and female proportion in relation to voting patterns for Republicans or Democrats.

## Datasets

- **US Election 2020 Dataset**
  - Contains 32,177 observations with data on state, county, candidate, party, total votes, and win status.

- **2020 Election Analysis Dataset**
  - Includes 3,045 observations focusing on state, county, candidate, party, total votes, win status, and additional county characteristics like population demographics and geographic coordinates.

- **American Community Survey (2019)**
  - Features 58 observations with median income data.

- **American Community Survey (2020)**
  - Consists of 54 observations with state-level demographic data.

## Key Findings

- County characteristics such as female population proportion and total population show explanatory power on voting behavior.
- Females tend to vote more for Democrats, while males lean towards Republicans.
- Median age is higher in Republican-leaning counties.
- Income per capita correlates negatively with Republican vote share, particularly in California.
  
## Analysis Highlights

- Descriptive statistics and regression analysis were conducted to identify influential variables.
- Stepwise variable selection suggested economic variables (income and unemployment rate) had no significant relationship with voting behavior.
- Machine learning approaches like regression trees outperformed simple linear regression in predicting voting outcomes.

## Conclusion

While income per capita appears to influence Republican vote share in certain contexts, causal inferences remain challenging with observable data due to potential biases. The analysis underscores the complexity of county characteristics in predicting voting behavior.
